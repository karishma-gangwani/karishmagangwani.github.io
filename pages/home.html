    <h2>Who Am I</h2>
    <p>I bridge the gap between complex scientific, medical data and meaningful human connections using storytelling. My unique blend of scientific expertise and communication skills allows me to transform intricate science into compelling narratives that resonate with a broad audience of all ages. In many societies which have been predominantly oral, stories not only provide entertainment but also history, moral and social education. And I'm passionate about exploring those through the lens of science.</p>
