                        Novel aromatic polyketides from soil Streptomyces spp.: purification, characterization and bioactivity studies
                    </a>
                </h3>
                <p class="blog-card-excerpt">Aromatic polyketides are important therapeutic compounds which include front line antibiotics and anticancer drugs. Since most of the aromatic polyketides are known to be produced by soil dwelling Streptomyces, 54 Streptomyces strains were isolated from the soil samples. Five isolates, R1, B1, R3, R5 and Y8 were found to be potent aromatic polyketide producers and were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Streptomyces spectabilis, Streptomyces olivaceus, Streptomyces purpurascens, Streptomyces coeruleorubidus and Streptomyces lavendofoliae respectively. </p>

                </h3>
                <p class="blog-card-excerpt">Cancer genomics and transcriptomics have revealed genes and pathways altered in several cancers. These studies have provided valuable information about cancer cells, their origin, oncogenic processes, and signaling pathways. An emerging challenge is to further characterize activity levels and interactions of pathways to develop a deeper understanding of how specific alterations in these interactions promote tumor growth.</p>

                <p class="blog-card-excerpt">Hippo pathway was initially identified through genetic screens for genes regulating organ size in fruitflies. Recent studies have highlighted the role of Hippo signaling as a key regulator of homeostasis, and in tumorigenesis. Hippo pathway is comprised of genes that act as tumor suppressor genes like hippo (hpo) and warts (wts), and oncogenes like yorkie (yki).</p>
